This repo holds the work I did when I completed CS224n assignments online. This focused on natural language processing, language modeling, neural machine translation, and deep learning (recurrent neural networks, deep feedforward neural networks, and convolutional neural networks). 
Disclamer: 
I did not go to Stanford, but all of the material is avaliable online and for free for people to learn from here http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/
